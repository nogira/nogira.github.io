# Blog Thing

Auto generates the HTML files for a minimal blog. The HTML files are based on the `template.html`, and txt files (written in markdown) in the `md_posts` folder. 

CSS is in `main.css`.

Contains prism js for code syntax highlighting (only a few languages I selected are included; for more, go to prism js website to generate you own prism js files with the languages you want).

Run `genFiles.py` to generate the website.
